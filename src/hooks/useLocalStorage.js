/**Custom hook used to keep state data in local storage
 *  Saves token to state. When token/state changes, local storage is updated
 * 
 * State:
 *    - item: first looks for this value in local storage. 
 *            If it cannot be found, uses 'firstValue' (defaults to null)
 * 
 * When item changes, effect reruns. 
 *  - if item is null, previous value for item is removed from local storage
 *  - otherwise, item value is updated in local storage
 * 
 * For components, this custom hook is no different from saving something in state. (Indeed, we 
 * are still saving a value in state. We are also just saving that value to local storage too 
 * with an effect)
 * 
 * Per the React docs, custom hooks are 'a mechanism to reuse stateful logic'. Therefore, each call
 * to a custom hook is fully isolated (just like each call to useState is completely isolated).
 * State saved in different componenets exists independently of one another
